# ChessStatsAndDataBase
This project gives the user an insight into my recent 3000+ games. You can view how many games were won, drawn and lost. You can analyze which openings were the safest and do much more. 
# Useage 
Play around and follow the instructions in main.py. This project is not very user friendly and expects some understanding of the game and python syntax. By adding your openAI key in gameExplainer.py and inserting a new game in "history" you can also have the AI generate a commentry for the game. A samaple game is avalible for you to play around with.

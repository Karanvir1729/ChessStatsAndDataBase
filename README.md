# ChessStatsAndDataBase
This project gives the user an insight into my recent 3000+ games. You can view how many games were won, drawn and lost. You can analyze which openings were the safest and do much more. 
# Useage
Play around and follow the instructions in main.py. This project is not very user friendly and expects some understanding of the game and python syntax.
